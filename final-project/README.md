Welcome to my final project for CS50! This project involves creating a personal website and blog to showcase my work and interests. Below, you'll find an overview of the project, its features, and how you can explore it.

### Project Overview
This website was built using the Astro.js framework, known for its efficiency in creating blogs. The project highlights my personal profile, the technologies I use, and references one of my main projects, Garden—a database documenting everything I learn.

### Features
- Header Navigation: The header includes navigation routes to other pages with onClick functions for seamless redirection. It also features icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Email.

- Main Page: Displays the three most recent posts. A "Check all posts" button reveals all posts. The design uses neo-brutalist styling with hover effects for an engaging user experience.

- Tag Filtering: Blog posts can be filtered by tags. Clicking on a tag displays posts related to that topic on a new page.

- Post View: Each post is a simple Markdown file, making it easy to create, use, and share.

- Now Page: A dedicated page where I share updates on what I’m working on both professionally and personally.

- Resume Page: Features various elements of my resume and offers the option to download my CV in PDF format, available in both English and Portuguese (my native language).

- Responsiveness: The site is fully responsive, adapting to mobile devices, tablets, and smaller screens. You can return to the main page at any time by clicking the Home button or my name in the top left corner.

### Deployment
The site is live at https://gabrielpalhares.dev. Feel free to visit and explore the details of the project. I used GitHub Pages for hosting.

#### Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue or a pull request if you have suggestions or improvements.
