Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

When conducting a limited number of simulations, the results can vary randomly.
For instance, a team such as Brazil might have a 60% chance in one instance and a 10% chance in another.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

When conducting 10,000 simulations, the results stabilized, indicating Belgium as the favorite,
followed by Brazil. After 10,000 simulations, the outcomes are typically consistent, so I would consider
10,000 to be sufficient.
